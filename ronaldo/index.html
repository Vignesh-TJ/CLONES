These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[115][116][117] Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history, measuring 2.93 meters, which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round-of-16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013.[118] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.</p>
